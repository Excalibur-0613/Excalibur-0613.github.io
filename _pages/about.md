My name is Benjamin "Ben" Russ, a Mechanical Engineer and Robotics Researcher with a focus on mobile robot behavior and perception. I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, graduating with both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. I am currently a Mechanical Design Engineer with Honeywell Intelligrated. In this role I am developing sensorization/embedded products for the Line Sortation product family among other R&D projects.

During my time in my graduate program and in my current explorations; I have come to the conclusion that the sense of "touch" in robots is a strange topic. In many of today's robotic challenges, the touch modality is simply unnecessary. For example,  industrial robotic arms or autonomous ground vehicles commonly deployed in factories and warehouses today. 

It has been proven from the current art and the most developed offerings from Boston Dynamics, Digit, Fanuc, Kuka, and others that vision and basic spatial perception suitably completes most tasks. However, as demonstrated in my graduate work and the current research body, so much more is possible that we may not yet understand. 

In this collection, you will find my thesis work and associated graduate projects in the "projects" tab above. Additionally, you will find documentation for current research I am conducting  and how it ties into my previous work.  My cv/resume and other professional information is contained under "CV". Lastly, I have a few extras to get to know me better through the "bookshelf" tab and my published repositories from these past projects. Thank you for visiting my site and lets connect over the exciting developments and discoveries for the next age of automation!
