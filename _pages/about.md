I'm Benjamin (Ben) Russ, a Mechanical Engineer and Robotics Researcher dedicated to advancing the field of automation. My passion lies in exploring the intersection of perception, contact, and dynamic behaviors in mobile robotics. I’m currently working as a Mechanical Design Engineer at Honeywell Intelligrated, developing embedded sensor systems and preventative maintenance technologies for industrial line sortation equipment.
## **What I Aim to Do

I’m driven to shape the future of robotics by diving deeper into underutilized areas of control and interaction. While most modern robotic systems rely heavily on visual and spatial perception, I believe the next leap in robotic capability lies in how we harness force, contact, and dynamics. My current work is developing an experimental motor driver and analog control system which responds directly to physical stimulus, bypassing traditional voltage digital loops. These experiments hint at a new method for responsive, force-aware robotics.

I seek to collaborate with others who are curious about how robots can interact more intuitively and responsively with the world. Whether it's for automation, space exploration, or collaborative manufacturing, I am excited by possibilities that lie beyond the visual domain.
## **Education and Academic Work

I earned both my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati. 

During my graduate studies, I was a fellow at the Space Research Institute for Discovery and Exploration (SRIDE). My thesis focused on developing a dynamic trajectory planner and impedance controller for collaborative object transport tasks.

This work included building a physical prototype, conducting simulations in ROS and Gazebo, and creating a functional controller model. Under the guidance of Dr. Tamara Lorenz, I authored a manuscript detailing these outcomes. While this work is not yet published, I continue to expand on its findings and hope to share a refined version in the future.
## **Research and Development Focus

My growing belief is that robotics has only scratched the surface when it comes to contact and cooperative dynamics. With thoughtful mechanical design, precise joint construction and control, and proper perception, we can enable control systems that mimic intuitive human-like responsiveness. The force feedback motor driver project is one such exploration, providing insight into how analog responses and mechanical design can substitute for more complex sensor integration.

This isn’t just theory—I’ve built and tested these systems to demonstrate real-world potential. I'm eager to contribute to projects and teams pushing the boundaries of what robotic interaction can achieve.
