## Old Writing

For a glimpse of who I am beyond engineering, the "Bookshelf" and "Gallery" tabs offer personal favorites and visual snapshots of my journey.

My name is Benjamin "Ben" Russ, a Mechanical Engineer and Robotics Researcher with a focus on mobile robot behavior and perception. I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, graduating with both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. I am currently a Mechanical Design Engineer with Honeywell Intelligrated. In this role I am developing sensor feedback and preventative maintenance embedded products for the Line Sortation product family among other R&D projects.

During my graduate program I was a fellow with the Space Research Institute for Discovery and Exploration (SRIDE) at the University of Cincinnati. Through this fellowship and thesis journey, I developed a dynamic trajectory planner and impedance controller to complete a collaborative object transportation task. The outcomes from my work included a controller model, ROS/Gazebo simulation, and a physical prototype robot which demonstrated the concepts and performance of the proposed system. Through this work I produced a manuscript along with my mentor and advisor, Dr. Tamara Lorenz, but ultimately have not published yet. Through my current investigations and new approaches to my thesis topics, I see great value in the data and learning from this writing I look forward to refining further. Within the "projects" tab of this collection I detail the full outcomes and background. 

In my current explorations and following my thesis, I am beginning to understand that vision and basic spatial perception suitably completes most tasks. This is including the current art and most matured offerings from Boston Dynamics, Digit, Fanuc, Kuka, and others. However, I firmly believe there is much more we have not yet harnessed with contact and dynamic robotics. Armed with the knowledge from my thesis and a passion for the next chapters of robotics, I continue to explore different approaches for facilitating contact and cooperation. This is illustrated in my force feedback motor driver project which has demonstrated that we do not need to translate a sensor voltage in a motor feedback loop. Rather, we can easily define an analog response to an input stimulus and remain limited to a system's mechanical inertia. Given a precise inertia ratio and high stiffness in a joint, a highly responsive control and feedback system is seeming to emerge. I look forward to continuing this work and I hope someone may find inspiration to continue expanding this exciting topic. 

Finally in this collection, I have detailed background and outcomes from my various projects in the "projects" tab above. The associated code from some of these projects is published under the "repositories" tab. I will note that some of these projects were group projects from graduate classes and I distinguish my contributions where appropriate. My cv/resume and other professional information is contained under "CV". Lastly, I have a few extras to get to know me better through the "bookshelf" and "gallery" tabs. I am always open to opportunities and ventures, please feel free to reach out using the links below or through my contact in my CV. Thank you for visiting my site and lets connect over the exciting developments and discoveries for the next age of automation! 

During my time in my graduate program and in my current explorations; I have come to the conclusion that the sense of "touch" in robots is a strange topic. In many of today's robotic challenges, the touch modality is simply unnecessary. For example,  industrial robotic arms or autonomous ground vehicles commonly deployed in factories and warehouses today. 



It has been proven from the current art and the most developed offerings from Boston Dynamics, Digit, Fanuc, Kuka, and others that vision and basic spatial perception suitably completes most tasks. However, as demonstrated in my graduate work and the current research body, so much more is possible that we may not yet understand.
