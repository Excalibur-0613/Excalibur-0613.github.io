Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.


## Old Writing
During my time in my graduate program and in my current explorations; I have come to the conclusion that the sense of "touch" in robots is a strange topic. In many of today's robotic challenges, the touch modality is simply unnecessary. For example,  industrial robotic arms or autonomous ground vehicles commonly deployed in factories and warehouses today. 



It has been proven from the current art and the most developed offerings from Boston Dynamics, Digit, Fanuc, Kuka, and others that vision and basic spatial perception suitably completes most tasks. However, as demonstrated in my graduate work and the current research body, so much more is possible that we may not yet understand.
