    "summary": "Mechanical Engineer and Robotics Researcher passionate about building responsive, force-aware robotic platforms. From academic research on multi-robot emergent behavior to industrial systems engineering at Honeywell, I integrate mechanical design with low-level control systems to enable adaptive, real-world robot performance. My experience in hardware, embedded control, and simulation allows me to develop and validate robust robotic testbeds that shorten iteration cycles",
